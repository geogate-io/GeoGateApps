# GeoGate Applications

The GeoGate applications demonstrate a wide range of features implemented by the using GeoGate co-processing component. The aim of the example applications are to provide example and template codes that are directly applicable to real world situations and might be used as an easy starting point to start developing new plugins or applications for GeoGate.

The structure of the repository is such that each top-level directory holds a self-contained use-case example/application. The detailed information about each configuration can be found on its own README file.
